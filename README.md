# your-first-quantum-game

[Quantum Games Hackathon 2021](https://www.qaif.org/contests/quantum-games-hackathon)

Workshop **Create your first quantum game in JavaScript** by [Piotr Migdał](https://p.migdal.pl/) from [Quantum Flytrap](https://quantumflytrap.com/).

## Setup

You need git and GitHub account.
We strongly recommend to use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor - powerful, easy-to-use, good support of JavaScript, free. 

To get files on your computer, first FORK this repository, then:

```{bash}
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/your-first-quantum-game.git
```

## What's that

We use pure HTML and JavaScript to create a browser experience.

We use [Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors](https://github.com/Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors) for quantum operations. 

Documentation: <https://quantum-flytrap.github.io/quantum-tensors/>. Examples of usage in <https://github.com/Quantum-Flytrap/quantum-tensors/tree/master/tests>.
